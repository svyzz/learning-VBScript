learning-VBScript
=================

This repository includes code that I wrote for *myself* towards learning VBScript(!). 

I *HAD* to learn VBScript as part of a new project that I've been working on recently and decided to take the fun approach for once and consequently came up with a simple click-based game that runs **ONLY on Windows** and another library of functions that can be plugged into QTP/UFT scripts (or not).

Whilst the game is complete, the library is a work-in-progress and I intend to extend the library with more functions when I have the time and patience to do so.

Details, Installation and Usage
======================
* **The Fastest Click** - is a game that tracks how fast you can click on two MsgBox buttons in succession. It turned out to be incredibly successful during a short trialing period amongst my colleagues and subsequently led to people cheating their way to high scores. Please read the source for more details!

* **The Function Library** contains a bunch of utilitarian functions that I wrote to learn the basics of VBScript. They make for good learning exercises and also help when you're writing automated scripts with QTP/UFT.

As with any VBS file, all you have to do is download and execute! The function library can be exported as a QFL file for usage inside of QTP/UFT.
